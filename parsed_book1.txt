tabby cat hed spotted that morning It was same one it had the same markings around its eyes Shoo said Mr Dursley loudly The cat didnt move It just gave him a stern look Was this normal cat behavior Mr

Could all this have that they were related to a pair of  well he didnt quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake turning it all over asleep was that even if the Potters were involved Mrs Dursley The Potters knew very well what he and couldnt see how he and Petunia could get mixed up turned over  it couldnt affect them  How very wrong he was Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sign of sleepiness It was sitting as still as a statue Drive It didnt so much as quiver when a car door swooped overhead In fact it was nearly midnight watching appeared so suddenly and silently youd cats tail twitched and its eyes narrowed Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet silver of his hair and beard which were both long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles had been broken at least twice This mans name was just arrived in a street where everything from his rummaging in his cloak looking for something But he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse known He found what he was looking for in his inside flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it clicked it again  the next lamp flickered into until the only lights left on the whole street were two the cat watching him If anyone looked out of their wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the wall next to the cat He didnt look at it but after a He turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the eyes She too was wearing a cloak an emerald one looked distinctly ruffled How did you know it was me she asked My dear Professor Ive never seen a cat sit so stiffly Youd be stiff if youd been sitting

admiring But youre Know oh all right Voldemort was frightened of had powers I will never have Only because youre too  well  noble to use Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at the rumors that are flying around You know what point she was most anxious to discuss the real day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she did now It was plain that whatever everyone was Dumbledore told her it was true Dumbledore not answer What theyre saying she pressed on is that last went to find the Potters The rumor is that Lily and gasped Lily and James  I

tell me why youre here of all Theyre the only family he has left now You dont mean  you cant mean the people who feet and pointing at number four Dumbledore  you find two people who are less like us

Hell be famous  known as Harry Potter Day in the future  there will world will know his name Exactly said Dumbledore looking very seriously enough to turn any boys head Famous before he can remember Cant you see how much better off hell be it Professor McGonagall opened her mouth changed her right of course But how is the boy getting here she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it Hagrids bringing him You think it  wise  to trust Hagrid with I would trust Hagrid with my life said Dumbledore Im not saying his heart isnt in the right place said pretend hes not careless He does tend to  what them It grew steadily louder as they looked up and swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky  on the road in front of them If the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man normal man and at least five times as wide He looked tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins In blankets Hagrid said Dumbledore sounding relieved At giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he sir No problems were there No sir  house was almost destroyed but I got him around He fell asleep as we was flyin over Bristol over the bundle of blankets Inside just visible was a over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped map of the London Underground Well  give him toward the Dursleys house Could I  could I say goodbye to

with Muggles   Yes yes its all very sad but get a grip on yourself whispered patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as walked to the front door He laid Harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it other two For a full minute the three of them stood shook Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and Dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone out Well said Dumbledore finally thats that Weve no celebrations Yeah said Hagrid in a very muffled voice Id best Professor Dumbledore sir Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve Hagrid engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off said Dumbledore nodding to her Professor On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end on the step of number four Good luck Harry he murmured He turned on his lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without beside

dressed he went down the hall into the Dudleys birthday presents It looked as though to mention the second television and the racing bike mystery to Harry as Dudley was very fat and hated somebody Dudleys favorite punching bag was Harry but he was very fast Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark skinny for his age He looked even smaller and wear were old clothes of Dudleys and Dudley was face knobbly knees black hair and bright green of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his had had it as long as he could

newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a rest of the boys in his class put together but it made the place Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in Uncle Vernon He had a large pink face not much that lay smoothly on his thick fat head Aunt Petunia Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a which was difficult as there wasnt much room face fell Thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and see its here under this big one from Mommy and in the face Harry who could see a huge Dudley fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger too because presents while were out today Hows that popkin Dudley thought for a moment It looked like hard thirty  Thirtynine sweetums said Aunt Petunia Oh Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the father Atta boy Dudley He ruffled Dudleys hair At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike a video computer games and a VCR He was ripping the back from the telephone looking both angry and leg She cant take him She jerked her head in gave a leap Every year on Dudleys birthday his adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the Figg a mad old lady who lived

at once Half an hour later Harry who couldnt believe his Piers and Dudley on the way to the zoo for the first to think of anything else to do with him but before purple face right up close to Harrys Im warning you and youll be in that cupboard from now until But Uncle Vernon didnt believe him No one ever did The problem was strange things often happened Dursleys he didnt make them happen Once Aunt Petunia tired of Harry coming back from had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair which she left to hide that horrible scar Dudley had night imagining school the next day where he was

been chasing him as usual when was sitting on the chimney The Dursleys had telling them Harry had been climbing school Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard was jump behind the big trash cans wind must have caught him in midjump But today nothing was going to go wrong It was even day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or Petunia He liked to complain about things people at

DONT FLY Dudley and Piers sniggered I know they dont said Harry It was only a dream But he wished he hadnt said anything If there was asking questions it was his talking about anything dream or even a cartoon  they seemed to think he crowded with families The Dursleys bought Dudley and then because the smiling lady in the van had him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop It watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked He was careful to walk a little way apart from the to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt ate in the zoo restaurant and when Dudley had a enough ice cream on

bedroom where the only wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a anyone was watching They werent He looked back Dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling It gave he wasnt sure the snake could hear him It must be The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the and Harry read on This specimen was bred in the behind Harry made both of them jump DUDLEY YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT ITS DOING Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he ribs Caught by surprise Harry fell hard on the one saw how it happened  one second Piers and next they had leapt back with howls of horror Harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor started running for the exits As the snake slid swiftly past him Harry could have  Thanksss amigo The keeper of the reptile house was in shock go  The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of again Piers and Dudley could only gibber As

first thought was that this big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys torches like the ones at Gringotts the ceiling was too facing them led to the upper floors They followed Professor McGonagall across the hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right  the Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a standing rather closer together than they would The startofterm banquet

Each House has its own witches and wizards While you are at Hogwarts your breaking will lose House points At the end of the House cup a great honor I hope each of you will be a minutes in front of the rest of the school I suggest while you are waiting Her eyes lingered for a moment on Nevilles cloak smudged nose Harry nervously tried to flatten his Professor McGonagall Please wait quietly She left the chamber Harry swallowed Ron Some sort of test I think Fred said it hurts a lot but the whole school But he didnt know any magic yet expected something like this the moment they everyone else looked terrified too No one was talking very fast about all the spells shed learned and to listen to her Hed never been more nervous never to the Dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his Any second now Professor McGonagall would come a foot in the air  several people behind him twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back glided across the room talking to one another and arguing What looked like a fat little monk was him a second chance   My dear Friar havent we given Peeves all the you know hes not really even a ghost  I say what noticed the first years Nobody answered New students said the Fat Friar smiling around at House you know Move along now said a sharp voice The Sorting ghosts floated away through the opposite wall Now form a line Professor McGonagall told the first Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with back across the hall and through a pair of double splendid place It was lit by thousands and thousands tables where the rest of the students were sitting and goblets At the top of the hall was another long McGonagall led the first years up here so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the the students the ghosts shone misty silver Mainly to saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars He heard outside I read about it in Hogwarts A History It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all heavens Harry quickly looked down again as Professor of the first years On top of the stool she put a pointed extremely dirty Aunt Petunia wouldnt have let it in thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing  the hat he stared at it too For a few seconds there near the brim opened wide like a mouth  and the Your top hats sleek and tall For Im the Hogwarts Sorting Hat The Sorting Hat cant see So try me on and I will tell you Set Gryffindors apart You might belong in Hufflepuff Where they are just and loyal Those patient Hufflepuffs are true Youll make your real friends Those cunning folk use any means its song It bowed to each of the four tables and then Harry Ill kill Fred he was going on about wrestling better than having to do a spell but he did wish they hat seemed to be asking rather a lot Harry didnt feel only the hat had mentioned a House for people who him Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a sit on the stool to be sorted she said Abbott A pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of eyes and sat down A moments pause  HUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat The table on the right cheered and clapped as her Bones Susan HUFFLEPUFF shouted the hat again and Susan several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Brown Lavender became the first new Gryffindor Harry could see Rons twin brothers catcalling Bulstrode Millicent then became a Slytherin heard about Slytherin but he thought they looked remembered being picked for teams during gym at his because he was no good but because no one wanted FinchFletchley Justin HUFFLEPUFF Sometimes Harry noticed the hat shouted out the decide Finnigan Seamus the sandyhaired boy whole minute before the hat declared him a eagerly on her head GRYFFINDOR shouted the hat Ron groaned A horrible thought struck Harry as horrible thoughts wasnt chosen at all What if he just sat there with McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had the train When Neville Longbottom the boy who kept losing his The hat took a long time to decide with Neville When wearing it and had to jog back amid gales of laughter and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched looking pleased with himself twin girls Path and Path   then Perks Sally out like little hissing fires all over the hall  Potter  did she say  The Harry Potter The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over good look at him Next second he was looking at the difficult Plenty of courage I see Not a bad mind nice thirst to prove yourself now thats interesting  Slytherin not Slytherin Not Slytherin eh said the small voice Are you your head and Slytherin will help you on the way to sure  better be GRYFFINDOR Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole the Gryffindor table He was so relieved to have been that he was getting the loudest cheer yet Percy the the Weasley twins yelled We got Potter We got hed seen earlier The ghost patted his arm giving into a bucket of icecold water He could see the High Table properly now At the end him the thumbs up Harry grinned back And there sat Albus Dumbledore Harry recognized him at once the train Dumbledores silver hair was the only thing Harry spotted Professor Quirrell too the nervous very peculiar in a large purple turban And now there were only four people left to be sorted joined Harry at the Gryffindor table Turpin Lisa was pale green by now Harry crossed his fingers shouted GRYFFINDOR Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed pompously across Harry as Zabini Blaise was scroll and took the Sorting Hat away Harry looked down at his empty gold plate He had pasties seemed ages ago beaming at the students his arms opened wide as if them all there Welcome he said Welcome to a new year at to say a few words And here they are Nitwit Blubber Oddment Tweak Thank you He sat back down Everybody clapped and cheered in the world But he is a bit mad yes Potatoes were now piled with food He had never seen so many chicken pork chops and lamb chops sausages fries Yorkshire pudding peas carrots gravy humbugs The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry but Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really with a bit of everything except the peppermints and watching Harry cut up his steak the ghost I dont need to of course but one does Nicholas de MimsyPorpington at your service brothers told me about you  youre Nearly Headless   the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired Seamus chat wasnt going at all the way he wanted Like this he said irritably He seized his left ear and onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge Someone properly Looking pleased at the stunned looks on back onto his neck coughed and said So  new House Championship this year Gryffindors have got the cup six years in a row The Bloody Barons ghost Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a gaunt face and robes stained with silver blood He see didnt look too pleased with the seating with great interest Ive never asked said Nearly Headless Nick remains of the food faded from the plates leaving desserts appeared Blocks of ice cream in every flavor eclairs and jam doughnuts trifle strawberries Jell turned to their families Im halfandhalf said Seamus Me dads a Muggle were married Bit of a nasty shock for him The others laughed What about you Neville said Ron Well my gran brought me up and shes a witch for ages My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once I nearly Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner and he was when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue way down the garden and into the road They were all really pleased Gran was crying she was so happy here  they thought I might not be magic enough to bought me my toad On Harrys other side Percy Weasley and Hermione away theres so much to learn Im particularly something into something else of course its small just matches into needles and that sort of looked up at the High Table again Hagrid was was talking to Professor Dumbledore Professor teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and looked past Quirrells turban straight into Harrys Harrys forehead Ouch Harry clapped a hand to his head What is it asked Percy Nnothing The pain had gone as quickly as it had come Harder teachers look  a feeling that he didnt like Harry at Whos that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell he hes looking so nervous thats Professor Snape He knows hes after Quirrells job Knows an awful lot look at him again At last the desserts too disappeared and Professor fed and watered I have a few startofterm notices to grounds is forbidden to all pupils And a few of our well Dumbledore s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction remind you all that no magic should be used between the term Anyone interested in playing for their House floor corridor on the righthand side is out of bounds death odd because he usually gives us a reason why were dangerous beasts everyone knows that I do think he song cried Dumbledore Harry noticed that the other trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden and twisted itself snakelike into words Everyone pick their favorite tune said Dumbledore Or young with scabby knees Our heads could do with filling So teach us things worth knowing Bring back what weve forgot Just do your best well do the rest And learn until our brains all rot Everybody finished the song at different times At last very slow funeral march Dumbledore conducted their finished he was one of those who clapped loudest Ah music he said wiping his eyes A magic trot The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the marble staircase Harrys legs were like lead again was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in pointed as they passed or that twice Percy led them hanging tapestries They climbed more staircases wondering how much farther they had to go when ahead of them and as Percy took a step toward them poltergeist He raised his voice Peeves  show A loud rude sound like the air being let out of a eyes and a wide mouth appeared floating cross Firsties What fun He swooped suddenly at them They all ducked Go away Peeves or the Baronll hear about this I the walking sticks on Nevilles head They heard him they set off again The Bloody Barons the only one prefects Here we are At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a forward to reveal a round hole in the wall They all and found themselves in the Gryffindor common dormitory and the boys through another At the top of towers  they found their beds at last five four trunks had already been brought up Too tired to talk the hangings Get off Scabbers Hes chewing my treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much because he Quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling was his destiny Harry told the turban he didnt want to pull it off but it tightened painfully  and there then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher was a burst of green light and Harry woke sweating woke next day he didnt remember the dream at all dormitory the next day People lining up outside doubled back to pass him in the corridors again trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes There were a hundred and fortytwo staircases at some that led somewhere different on a Friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to wouldnt open unless you asked politely or tickled really doors at all but solid walls just pretending It because it all seemed to move around a lot The and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk The ghosts didnt help either It was always a nasty door you were trying to open Nearly Headless Nick right direction but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth when you were late for class He would drop under your feet pelt you with bits of chalk or sneak GOT YOUR CONK Even worse than Peeves if that was possible was the on the wrong side of him on their very first morning door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to wouldnt believe they were lost was sure they were threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they colored creature with bulging lamplike eyes just like in front of her put just one toe out of line and shed seconds later Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone except perhaps the of the ghosts The students all hated him and it was good kick And then once you had managed to find them there magic as Harry quickly found out than waving your telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn planets Three times a week they went out to the with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout plants and fungi and found out what they were used which was the only one taught by a ghost Professor asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next droned on and on while they scribbled down names Oddball mixed up Professor Flitwick the Charms teacher was a tiny see over his desk At the start of their first class he he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight Professor McGonagall was again different Harry had cross Strict and clever she gave them a talking to dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts she and not come back You have been warned Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again started but soon realized they werent going to be After taking a lot of complicated notes they were each needle By the end of the lesson only Hermione Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had smile The class everyone had really been looking forward to lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke His classroom ward off a vampire hed met in Romania and was days His turban he told them had been given to him a troublesome zombie but they werent sure they Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had talking about the weather for another they had and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full wherever he went miles behind everyone else Lots of people had come idea that they were witches and wizards There was so much of a head start Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron They Hall for breakfast without getting lost once What have we got today Harry asked Ron as he Snapes Head of Slytherin House They say he always McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House but it homework the day before Just then the mail arrived Harry had gotten used to the first morning when about a hundred owls had breakfast circling the tables until they saw their laps Hedwig hadnt brought Harry anything so far She toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar tore it open at once It said in a very untidy scrawl to come and have a cup of tea with me around three I want to hear all about your first week Send us an you later on the back of the note and sent Hedwig off forward to because the Potions lesson turned out to idea that Professor Snape disliked him By the end of Snape didnt dislike Harry  he hated him Potions lessons took place down in one of the castle and would have been quite creepy enough around the walls Snape like Flitwick started the class by taking the celebrity Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle the names and looked up at the class His eyes were warmth They were cold and empty and made you of potionmaking he began He spoke in barely more Professor McGonagall Snape had the gift of keeping a wand waving here many of you will hardly believe the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its creep through human veins bewitching the mind fame brew glory even stopper death  if you arent teach More silence followed this little speech Harry and Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked dunderhead Potter said Snape suddenly What would I get if I wormwood Powdered root of what to an infusion of what Harry Hermione s hand had shot into the air I dont know sir said Harry Snape s lips curled into a sneer Tut tut  fame clearly isnt everything He ignored Hermione s hand you to find me a bezoar Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar was He were shaking with laughter I dont know sir Thought you wouldnt open a book before coming those cold eyes He had looked through his books at everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and and wolfsbane At this Hermione stood up her hand stretching does though why dont you try her A few people laughed Harry caught Seamuss eye pleased Sit down he snapped at Hermione For your sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from are the same plant which also goes by the name of parchment Over the noise Snape said And a point Potter Things didnt improve for the Gryffindors as the pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake whom he seemed to like He was just telling everyone horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a managed to melt Seamuss cauldron into a twisted floor burning holes in peoples shoes Within while Neville who had been drenched in the potion angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs Idiot boy snarled Snape clearing the spilled potion added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron his nose Take him up to the hospital wing Snape spat at had been working next to Neville the quills Thought hed make you look good if he got Gryffindor This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to turn very nasty As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour low Hed lost two points for Gryffindor in his very off Fred and George Can I come and meet Hagrid across the grounds Hagrid lived in a small wooden and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling voice rang out saying Back Fang  back Hagrid s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he of an enormous black boarhound There was only one room inside Hams and pheasants boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a Fang who bounded straight at Ron and started fierce as he looked This is Ron Harry told Hagrid who was pouring cakes onto a plate Another Weasley eh said Hagrid glancing at Rons away from the forest The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all Harrys knee and drooled all over his robes Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call her to Fang sometime Dyeh know every time I go up rid of her  Filch puts her up to it Harry told Hagrid about Snapes lesson Hagrid like liked hardly any of the students But he seemed to really hate me Rubbish said Hagrid Why should he quite meet his eyes when he said that Hows yer brother Charlie Hagrid asked Ron I purpose While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlies that was lying on the table under the tea cozy It was on   July widely believed to be the work of Dark been taken The vault that was searched had in fact your noses out if you know whats good for you said someone had tried to rob Gringotts but Ron hadnt happened on my birthday It mightve been happening meet Harrys eyes this time He grunted and offered earlier that same day Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying what the thieves were looking for As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for theyd been too polite to refuse Harry thought that much to think about as tea with Hagrid Had Hagrid now And did Hagrid know something about Snape 9 hated more than Dudley but that was before he met Potions with the Slytherins so they didnt have to put they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor lessons would be starting on Thursday  and wanted To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in than anything else You dont know that youll make a fool of yourself going on about how good he is at Quidditch but I bet

tell hang glider on Charlies old broom Everyone from Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with had caught Ron prodding Deans poster of West Ham because his grandmother had never let him near one Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of flying as Neville was This was something you couldnt tried At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all book called Quidditch Through the Ages Neville was that might help him hang on to his broomstick later lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail Harry hadnt had a single letter since Hagrids note course Malfoy s eagle owl was always bringing him gloatingly at the Slytherin table A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his them a glass ball the size of a large marble which forget things  this tells you if theres something and if it turns red  oh  His face fell because the forgotten something  Neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten table snatched the Remembrall out of his hand Harry and Ron jumped to their feet They were half McGonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any back on the table Just looking he said and he sloped away with other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto breezy day and the grass rippled under their feet as to the forbidden forest whose trees were swaying broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground Harry the school brooms saying that some of them started to the left Their teacher Madam Hooch arrived She had short Everyone stand by a broomstick Come on hurry some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles Stick out your right hand over your broom called was one of the few that did Hermione Grangers had moved at all Perhaps brooms like horses could tell quaver in Nevilles voice that said only too clearly that brooms without sliding off the end and walked up Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy hed been Now when I blow my whistle you kick off from the brooms steady rise a few feet and then come straight  three  two   But Neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of whistle had touched Madam Hoochs lips Come back boy she shouted but Neville was rising feet  twenty feet Harry saw his scared white face slip sideways off the broom and  WHAM  a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay still rising higher and higher and started to drift white as his Broken wrist Harry heard her mutter Come on hospital wing You leave those brooms where they are Quidditch Come on dear Neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist around him into laughter Did you see his face the great lump The other Slytherins joined in Shut up Malfoy snapped Parvati Patil Ooh sticking up for Longbottom said Pansy youd like fat little crybabies Parvati Look said Malfoy darting forward and snatching Longbottoms gran sent him The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up Give that here Malfoy said Harry quietly Everyone  how about  up a tree Give it here Harry yelled but Malfoy had leapt onto could fly well Hovering level with the topmost Potter Harry grabbed his broom iVo shouted Hermione Granger Madam Hooch told Harry ignored her Blood was pounding in his ears He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the hair and his robes whipped out behind him  and in he could do without being taught  this was easy little to take it even higher and heard screams and whoop from Ron He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in broom Oh yeah said Malfoy trying to sneer but looking and grasped the broom tightly in both hands and it out of the way in time Harry made a sharp about were clapping No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck the glass ball high into the air and streaked back in the air and then start to fall He leaned forward he was gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball screams of people watching  he stretched out his time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently his fist HARRY POTTER His heart sank faster than hed just dived Professor feet trembling Never  in all my time at Hogwarts   Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with you  might have broken your neck   It wasnt his fault Professor   Be quiet Miss Patil   But Malfoy   Thats enough Mr Weasley Potter follow me now Harry caught sight of Malfoy Crabbe and Goyles Professor McGonagalls wake as she strode toward the there seemed to be something wrong with his voice even looking at him he had to jog to keep up Now packing his bags in ten minutes What would the and still Professor McGonagall didnt say a word to corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her thought of Hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on as His stomach twisted as he imagined it watching Ron around the grounds carrying Hagrids bag Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom for a moment Wood thought Harry bewildered was Wood a cane boy who came out of Flitwicks class looking they marched on up the corridor Wood looking that was empty except for Peeves who was busy into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out behind him and turned to face the two boys Seeker Woods expression changed from puzzlement to boys a natural Ive never seen anything like it Was going on but he didnt seem to be being expelled and dive Professor McGonagall told Wood Didnt even it Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had excitedly Woods captain of the Gryffindor team Professor walking around Harry and staring at him Light  Professor  a Nimbus Two Thousand or a cant bend the firstyear rule Heaven knows we need match by Slytherin I couldnt look Severus Snape in at Harry I want to

there to take over if you die said Catching the look on Harrys face he added quickly real wizards The most you and Malfoyll be able to do enough magic to do any real damage I bet he suggested Excuse me They both looked up It was Hermione Granger Cant a person eat in peace in this place said Ron Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry I couldnt help overhearing what you and Malfoy at night think of the points youll lose Gryffindor if selfish of you And its really none of your business said Harry to the day Harry thought as he lay awake much later wasnt back from the hospital wing Ron had spent curse you youd better dodge it because I cant chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs breaking another school rule today On the other the darkness  this was his big chance to beat go They pulled on their bathrobes picked up their spiral staircase and into the Gryffindor common turning all the armchairs into hunched black when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them I wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown You said Ron furiously Go back to bed portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole Hermione wasnt going to give up that easily She them like an angry goose Dont you care about Gryffindor do you only care House Cup and youll lose all the points I got from Spells Go away All right but I warned you you just remember what youre so   But what they were they didnt find out Hermione inside and found herself facing an empty painting The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and were going to be late They hadnt even reached the end of the corridor You are not Dyou think Im going to stand out here and wait for him the truth that I was trying to stop you and you something It was a sort of snuffling Mrs Norris breathed Ron squinting through the on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake hours I couldnt remember the new password to get snout but it wont help you now the Fat Ladys gone mended it in about a minute Good  well look Neville weve got to be Dont leave me said Neville scrambling to his feet I dont want to stay here alone the Bloody Barons Hermione and Neville If either of you get us caught Ill never rest until Ive about and used it on you Hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell Ron hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all moonlight from the high windows At every turn Harry were lucky They sped up a staircase to the third floor trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught and gold in the darkness They edged along the walls room Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in someone speak  and it wasnt Malfoy Sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a It was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris Horrorstruck quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the barely whipped round the corner when they heard probably hiding This way Harry mouthed to the others and of suits of armor They could hear Filch getting and broke into a run  he tripped grabbed Ron into a suit of armor The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the down the gallery not looking back to see whether doorpost and galloped down one corridor then they were or where they were going  they ripped passageway hurtled along it and came out near their the trophy room I think weve lost him Harry panted leaning against bent double wheezing and spluttering I  told  you Hermione gasped clutching at the Weve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower said Ron realize that dont you He was never going to meet trophy room Malfoy must have tipped him off Harry thought she was probably right but he wasnt more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled front of them It was Peeves He caught sight of them and gave a out Peeves cackled Wandering around at midnight Ickle Firsties Tut voice but his eyes glittered wickedly Its for your Peeves  this was a big mistake STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a the door Were done for This is the end They could hear footsteps Filch running as fast as he Harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their Quick tell me Say please  Dont mess with me Peeves now where did they go Shant say nothing if you dont say please said if you didnt say please Ha ha Haaaaaa And they cursing in rage think well be okay  get off Neville For Neville had last minute What Harry turned around  and saw quite clearly what nightmare  this was too much on top of everything were in a corridor The forbidden corridor on the third monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs It was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them already dead was that their sudden appearance had that there was no mistaking what those thunderous death hed take Filch They fell backward  Harry slammed the door shut corridor Filch must have hurried off to look for them anywhere but they hardly cared  all they wanted to and that monster They didnt stop running until they floor Where on earth have you all been she asked and their flushed sweaty faces Never mind that  pig snout pig snout panted scrambled into the common room and collapsed Neville indeed looked as if hed never speak again What do they think theyre doing keeping a thing any dog needs exercise that one does Hermione had got both her breath and her bad snapped Didnt you see what it was standing on The floor Harry suggested I wasnt looking at its obviously guarding something She stood up glaring at them I hope youre pleased with yourselves We could all dont mind Im going to bed Ron stared after her his mouth open her along wouldnt you But Hermione had given Harry something else to guarding something    What had Hagrid said something you wanted to hide  except perhaps grubby little package from vault seven hundred and 0 Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting adventure and they were quite keen to have another package that seemed to have been moved from wondering what could possibly need such heavy Ron Or both said Harry But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious didnt have much chance of guessing what it was interest in what lay underneath the dog and the the dog again Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and saw this as an added bonus All they really wanted great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail everyones attention was caught at once by a long was just as interested as everyone else to see what owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a because it said DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand but I broomstick or theyll all want one Oliver Wood will oclock for your first training session Professor M McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the A Nimbus Two Thousand Ron moaned enviously broomstick in private before their first class but upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle Malfoy seized Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face allowed them Ron couldnt resist it Its not any old broomstick he said its a Nimbus Malfoy a Comet Two Sixty Ron grinned at Harry league as the Nimbus What would you know about it Weasley you I suppose you and your brothers have to save up at Malfoys elbow Not arguing I hope boys he squeaked Potters been sent a broomstick Professor said beaming at Harry Professor McGonagall told me all model is it not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoys face he added Harry and Ron headed upstairs smothering their top of the marble staircase If he hadnt stolen rules came an angry voice from just behind them disapprovingly at the package in Harrys hand I thought you werent speaking to us said Harry Yes dont stop now said Ron its doing us so lessons that day It kept wandering up to the his bed or straying off to the Quidditch field where dinner that evening without noticing what he was the Nimbus Two Thousand at last Wow Ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto brooms thought it looked wonderful Sleek and neat straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field Hed seats were raised in stands around the field so that going on At either end of the field were three golden the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the the goal posts and then sped up and down the field wanted at his lightest touch Hey Potter come down Oliver Wood had arrived He was carrying a large him Very nice said Wood his eyes glinting I see what just going to teach you the rules this evening then balls Right said Wood Now Quidditch is easy enough to seven players on each side Three of them are called Three Chasers Harry repeated as Wood took out a Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the the hoops to score Harry recited So  thats sort of it Whats basketball said Wood curiously Never mind said Harry quickly Now theres another player on each side whos called around our hoops and stop the other team from determined to remember it all And they play with pointed at the three balls left inside the box Ill show you now said Wood Take this He handed Harry a small club a bit like a short said These two are the Bludgers He showed Harry two identical balls jet black and that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps freed one of the Bludgers At once the black ball rose high in the air and then the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it heads and then shot at Wood who dived on top of it back into the crate and strapping it down safely The their brooms Thats why you have two Beaters on job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and got all that Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle the Bludgers away from their team Harry reeled off Very good said Wood Er  have the Bludgers ever killed anyone Harry jaws but nothing worse than that Now the last you dont have to worry about the Quaffle or the Dont worry the Weasleys are more than a match for Bludgers themselves Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth Bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut wings This said Wood is the Golden Snitch and its the because its so fast and difficult to see Its the of the Chasers Beaters Bludgers and Quaffle to get Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra Thats why Seekers get fouled so much A game of can go on for ages  I

feast Harry and Ron overheard was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be a moment later they had entered the Great Hall their minds A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and tables in low black clouds making the candles in the the golden plates as it had at the startofterm when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall stared as he reached Professor Dumbledores chair the dungeons  thought you ought to know He then sank to the floor in a dead faint There was an uproar It took several purple Dumbledores wand to bring silence dormitories immediately Percy was in his element Follow me Stick together first years No need to fear me now Make way first years coming through climbed the stairs Dont ask me theyre supposed to be really stupid joke They passed different groups of people hurrying in a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs Harry suddenly see us Ducking down they joined the Hufflepuffs going the hurried off toward the girls bathroom They had just behind them stone griffin Peering around it however they saw not Percy but view Whats he doing Harry whispered Why isnt he after Snape s fading footsteps Hes heading for the third floor Harry said but Ron mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet Ron pointed  at moving toward them They shrank into the shadows dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder coconut It had short legs thick as tree trunks with incredible It was holding a huge wooden club which The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside slouched slowly into the room The keys in the lock Harry muttered We could praying the troll wasnt about to come out of it With the door and lock it Yes Flushed with their victory they started to run back heard something that made their hearts stop  a chamber theyd just chained up Oh no said Ron pale as the Bloody Baron Its the girls bathroom Harry gasped  Hermionel they said together It was the last thing they wanted to do but what back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their inside Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the Confuse it Harry said desperately to Ron and the wall The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione It made the noise Its mean little eyes saw Harry It as it went Oy peabrain yelled Ron from the other side of the didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead giving to pull her toward the door but she couldnt move with terror The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the who was nearest and had no way to escape Harry then did something that was both very brave managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit in his hand when hed jumped  it had gone straight club with Harry clinging on for dear life any second terrible blow with the club out his own wand  not knowing what he was going into his head Wingardium Leviosal The club flew suddenly out of the trolls hand rose dropped with a sickening crack onto its owners on its face with a thud that made the whole room breath Ron was standing there with his wand still knocked out He bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls glue Urgh  troll boogers He wiped it on the trolls trousers A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the racket they had been making but of course someone trolls roars A moment later Professor McGonagall Snape with Quirrell bringing up the rear Quirrell sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart Snape bent over the troll Professor McGonagall was look so angry Her lips were white Hopes of winning mind What on earth were you thinking of said Professor at Ron who was still standing with his wand in the in your dormitory Snape gave Harry a swift piercing look Harry looked me Miss Granger Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last I went looking for the troll because I  I thought I Ive read all about them Ron dropped his wand Hermione Granger telling a stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out fetch anyone It was about to finish me off when they Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story staring at the three of them Miss Granger you mountain troll on your own Hermione hung her head Harry was speechless the rules and here she was pretending she had to handing out sweets Miss Granger five points will

us out of trouble like that Ron locked the thing in with her Harry reminded him They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady Pig snout they said and entered The common room was packed and noisy Everyone however stood alone by the door waiting for them them looking at each other they all said Thanks their friend There are some things you cant share out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them QUIDDITCH As they entered November the weather turned very gray and the lake like chilled steel Every morning the from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on overcoat rabbit fur gloves

somehow and Harry hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a all his homework without her what with all the last do She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players happen to them that although people rarely died and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for three of them were out in the freezing courtyard blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar warm when Snape crossed the yard Harry noticed at Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from Unfortunately something about their guilty faces the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to Library books are not to be taken outside the Gryffindor Hes just made that rule up Harry muttered angrily his leg Dunno but I hope its really hurting him said Ron evening Harry Ron and Hermione sat together next Charms homework for them She would never let to read it through they got the right answers anyway Harry felt restless He wanted Quidditch Through the tomorrow Why should he be afraid of Snape Getting Snape if he could have it Better you than me they said together but Harry other teachers listening He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked worth a try He pushed the door ajar and peered holding his robes above his knees One of his legs was bandages supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at robes quickly to hide his leg Harry gulped I just wondered if I could have my book back GET OUT OUT Harry left before Snape could take any more points Whats the matter In a low whisper Harry told them what hed seen You know what this

I after Whats that dog guarding Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the couldnt sleep He tried to empty his mind  he match in a few hours  but the expression on to forget The next morning dawned very bright and cold The sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking onto the field Harry you need your strength said Seamus clobbered by the other team Thanks Seamus said Harry watching Seamus pile in the stands around the Quidditch pitch Many high in the air but it was still difficult to see what Ron and Hermione joined Neville Seamus and Dean Harry they had painted a large banner on one of the President and Dean who was good at drawing had Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch we were on the team last year Shut up you two said Wood This is the best team it He glared at them all as if to say Or else Right Its time Good luck all of you Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker walked onto the

it and beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint Slytherin in possession Lee Jordan was saying and Chaser Bell and speeds toward the  wait a dropped the Quaffle too busy looking over his ear Harry saw it In a great rush of excitement he dived Terence Higgs had seen it too Neck and neck they to have forgotten what they were supposed to be Harry was faster than Higgs  he could see the little put on an extra spurt of speed  WHAM A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors and Harrys broom spun off course Harry holding on a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor But in all disappeared from sight again Down in the stands Dean Thomas was yelling Send shown the red card and youre out of the game But this isnt soccer Dean Ron reminded him Hagrid however was on Deans side

his breath Hes doing something  jinxing the broom said Before Ron could say another word Hermione had Harry His broom was vibrating so hard it was almost whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified

row knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in out her wand and whispered a few wellchosen the hem of Snape s robes It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize done her job Scooping the fire off him into a little jar Snape would never know what had happened It was enough Up in the air Harry was suddenly able sobbing into Hagrids jacket for the last five minutes Harry was speeding toward the ground when the he was about to be sick  he hit the field on all fours head and the game ended in complete confusion He didnt catch it he nearly swallowed it Flint was difference  Harry hadnt broken any rules and Lee Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrids saw him He was cursing your broomstick muttering what had gone on next

what Snape was know where to begin not knowing what Flamel might Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century or Notable Important Modern Magical Discoveries and A Study of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of of narrow rows Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had books and started pulling them off the shelves at Section He had been wondering for a while if Flamel needed a specially signed note from one of the knew hed never get one These were the books Hogwarts and only read by older students studying Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather story Harry left the library He Ron and Hermione Pince where they could find Flamel They were sure Snape hearing what they were up to Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other They had been looking for two weeks after all but as surprising theyd found nothing What they really breathing down their necks Five minutes later Ron and Hermione joined him said Hermione And send me an owl if you find Flamel is said Ron Itd be safe to ask them Very safe as theyre both dentists said Hermione Once the holidays had started Ron and Harry were They had the dormitory to themselves and the were able to get the good armchairs by the fire They toasting fork  bread English muffins expelled which were fun to talk about even if they was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures battle Rons set was very old and battered Like someone else in his family  in this case his drawback at all Ron knew them so well he never had lent him and they didnt trust him at all He wasnt a bits of advice at him which was confusing Dont can afford to lose him On Christmas Eve Harry went to bed looking forward expecting any presents at all When he woke early in small pile of packages at the foot of his bed Merry Christmas said Ron sleepily as Harry some presents What did you expect turnips said Ron turning to thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To flute Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself

unwrapped it Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans hed gotten really rare and really valuable What is it Harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor It material Its an Invisibility Cloak said Ron a look of awe on gave a yell It is Look down Harry looked down at his feet but they were gone He looked back at him just his head suspended in cloak over his head and his reflection vanished it Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter before were the following words is time it was returned to you Use it well A Very Merry Christmas to you There was no signature Harry stared at the note Ron Whats the matter Nothing said Harry He felt very strange Who had father Before he could say or think anything else the Weasley bounded in Harry stuffed the cloak quickly else yet Merry Christmas Hey look  Harrys got a Weasley sweater too Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters one holding up Harrys sweater She obviously makes demanded Come on get it on theyre lovely and I hate maroon Ron moaned halfheartedly as he were not stupid  we know were called Gred and looking disapproving He had clearly gotten halfway lumpy sweater

Percy from the room his arms dinner A hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich crackers every few feet along the table These Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought with their Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didnt the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered Flitwick had just read him Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey embedded in his slice Harry watched Hagrid getting wine finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the blushed her top hat lopsided When Harry finally left the table he was laden down pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a Grow set The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a Norriss Christmas dinner Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Percy hadnt tried to help him so much After a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy because theyd stolen his prefect badge It had been Harrys best Christmas day ever Yet all day Not until he climbed into bed was he free to sent it Ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing as hed drawn the curtains of his fourposter Harry cloak out from under it His fathers  this had been his fathers He let the as air Use it well the note had said He had to try it now He slipped out of bed and his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows It was a Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak Excitement and silence He could go anywhere in this anywhere Something held him back  his fathers cloak  he it alone He crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across hole Whos there squawked the Fat Lady Harry said Where should he go He stopped his heart racing Section in the library Hed be able to read as long as was He set off drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight lamp to see his way along the rows of books The even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it library Stepping carefully over the rope that held up his lamp to read the titles They didnt tell him much Their peeling faded gold understand Some had no title at all One book had a hairs on the back of Harrys neck prickled Maybe he whispering was coming from the books as though carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom and silver volume caught his eye He pulled it out balancing it on his knee let it fall open A piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence  the shriek went on and on one high unbroken over his lamp which went out at once Panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside  for it He passed Filch in the doorway Filchs pale slipped under Filchs outstretched arm and streaked his ears He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of library he hadnt paid attention to where he was recognize where he was at all There was a suit of five floors above there You asked me to come directly to you Professor if somebodys been in the library  Restricted Section Harry felt the blood drain out of his face Wherever he greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it they cant be far well catch them Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if the cloak didnt stop him from being solid He backed away as quietly as he could A door stood through it holding his breath trying not to move it without their noticing anything They walked straight deeply listening to their footsteps dying away That had been close very close It was a few seconds hidden in It looked like an unused classroom The dark shapes there was an upturned wastepaper basket  but that didnt look as if it belonged there something that out of the way It was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling feet There was an inscription carved around the top and Snape Harry moved nearer to the mirror He stepped in front of it He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself pounding far more furiously than when the book had mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right turned slowly back to the mirror There he was reflected in it white and scared ten others Harry looked over his shoulder  but still he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this not right behind his reflection was smiling at him and him If she was really there hed touch her their  she and the others existed only in the mirror She was a very pretty woman She had dark red hair thought edging a little closer to the glass Bright that she was crying smiling but crying at the same to her put his arm around her He wore glasses and as Harrys did Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror like his even a little old man who looked as though his family for the first time in his life The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared the glass as though he was hoping to fall right ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness How long he stood there he didnt know The until a distant noise brought him back to his senses bed He tore his eyes away from his mothers face room You could have woken me up said Ron crossly You can come tonight Im going back I want to show youll be able to show me your other brothers and come round my house this summer Anyway maybe Flamel though Have some bacon or something why would be seeing them again tonight He had almost anymore Who cared what the threeheaded dog was able to find the mirror room again With Ron covered the next night They tried retracing Harrys route from for nearly an hour Im freezing said Ron Lets forget it and go back IVo Harry hissed I know its here somewhere opposite direction but saw no one else Just as Ron Harry spotted the suit of armor Its here  just here  yes They pushed the door open Harry dropped the cloak sight of him See Harry whispered I cant see anything Look Look at them all  there are loads of them  mirror he couldnt see his family anymore just Ron Look at me he said Can you see all your family standing around you No  Im alone  but Im different  I look older  I am  Im wearing the badge like Bill used to  and Im Quidditch captain too Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to another look   You had it to yourself all last night give me a bit interesting about that I want to see my parents Dont push me   A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to had been talking Quick Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous Harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing age she turned and left This isnt safe  she might have gone for Filch I bet Want to play chess Harry said Ron No Why dont we go down and visit Hagrid No  you go  I know what youre thinking about Harry that anyway youve had too many close shaves already So what if they cant see you What if they walk into was to get back in front of the mirror and Ron wasnt before He was walking so fast he knew he was anyone And there were his mother and father smiling at him Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the here all night with his family Nothing at all Except  looked behind him Sitting on one of the desks by the must have walked straight past him so desperate to you said Dumbledore and Harry was relieved to see the floor with Harry you like hundreds before you Dumbledore gently Now can you think what the able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror as he is Does that help what we want  whatever we want  Yes and no said Dumbledore quietly It shows us desperate desire of our hearts You who have never Ronald Weasley who has always been overshadowed of all of them However this mirror will give us before it entranced by what they have seen or been even possible The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow you ever do run across it you will now be prepared It remember that Now why dont you put that something Obviously youve just done so Dumbledore smiled Dumbledore Another Christmas has come and gone giving me books It was only when he was back in bed that it struck truthful But then he thought as he shoved question for the Mirror of Erised again and for the rest of the folded at the bottom of his trunk Harry wished he but he couldnt He started having nightmares Over disappearing in a flash of green light while a high drive you mad said Ron when Harry told him about started took a different view of things She was torn roaming the school three nights in a row If Filch had least found out who Nicolas Flamel was They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel hed read the name somewhere Once term had for ten minutes during their breaks Harry had even practice had started again Wood was working the team harder than ever Even dampen his spirits The Weasleys complained that Woods side If they won their next match against House Championship for the first time in seven years had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after session Wood gave the team a bit of bad news Hed divebombing each other and pretending to fall off exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the match any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these mouthful of mud Whens he ever refereed a overtake Slytherin complain too Its not my fault said Wood Weve just got to make excuse to pick on us Which was all very well thought Harry but he had he was playing Quidditch  The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another straight back to the Gryffindor common room where the only thing Hermione ever lost at something Harry sat down next to him I need to concern He caught sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee Dont play said Hermione at once Say youre ill said Ron Pretend to break your leg Hermione suggested  Really break your leg said Ron I cant said Harry There isnt a reserve Seeker If I At that moment Neville toppled into the common portrait hole was anyones guess because his legs once as the LegLocker Curse He must have had to leapt up and performed the countercurse Nevilles over to sit with Harry and Ron Malfoy said Neville shakily I met him outside the practice that on Go to Professor McGonagall Hermione urged Hes used to walking all over people but thats no in Gryffindor Malfoys already done that Neville Chocolate Frog the very last one from the box Neville who looked as though he might cry Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor didnt it And unwrapped the frog Thanks Harry  I think Ill go to bed  Dyou want Wizard card Dumbledore again he said He was the first one I looked up at Ron and Hermione Ive found him he whispered Ive found Flamel I on the train coming here  listen to this Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of discovery of the twelve uses of dragons blood and his excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their to the girls dormitories Harry and Ron barely had dashing back an enormous old book in her arms I never thought to look in here she whispered bit of light reading until shed looked something up and started flicking Hermione ignored him Nicolas Flamel she whispered dramatically is the there She pushed the book toward them and Harry and making the Sorcerers Stone a legendary substance any metal into pure gold It also produces the Elixir of over the centuries but the only Stone currently in alchemist and opera lover Mr Flamel who celebrated enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife Perenelle See said Hermione when Harry and Ron had Sorcerers Stone I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep someone was after it thats why he wanted the Stone dying said Harry No wonder Snapes after it Anyone would want it And no wonder we couldnt find Flamel in that Study not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixtyfive is while copying down different ways of treating werewolf do with a Sorcerers Stone if they had one It wasnt Harry remembered about Snape and the coming dont all the Slytherins will think Im just too scared smiles off their faces if we win Just as long as were not wiping you off the field more and more nervous whatever he told Ron and either The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House seven years but would they be allowed to with such Harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or not he went At times he even wondered whether Snape Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly possibly know theyd found out about the Sorcerers sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that Ron see him alive again This wasnt what youd call talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked the stands next to Neville who couldnt understand both brought their wands to the match Little did practicing the LegLocker Curse Theyd gotten the to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve I know Ron snapped Dont nag Back in the locker room Wood had taken Harry need an early capture of the Snitch its now Finish much The whole schools out there said Fred Weasley Dumbledores come to watch Harrys heart did a somersault Dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make silver beard Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as noticed too Ive never seen Snape look so mean he told was Malfoy Oh sorry Weasley didnt see you there Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle Wonder how long Potters going to stay on his broom Weasley Ron didnt answer Snape had just awarded a Bludger at him Hermione who had all her fingers who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the Gryffindor team said Malfoy loudly a few minutes for no reason at all Its people they feel sorry for See theres Potter whos got no parents then theres on the team Longbottom youve got no brains Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game Weasley and thats saying something Rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet Youre in luck Weasley Potters obviously spotted Ron snapped Before Malfoy knew what was the ground Neville hesitated then clambered over the her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape  under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the Snitch could ever remember the Snitch being caught so won Weve won Gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front Harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground over it had barely lasted five minutes As Gryffindors nearby whitefaced and tightlipped  then Harry felt Dumbledores smiling face Well done said Dumbledore quietly so that only brooding about that mirror    been keeping busy    Snape spat bitterly on the ground Jc Jc Jc Harry left the locker room alone some time later to broomshed He couldnt ever remember feeling now  no one could say he was just a famous name sweet He walked over the damp grass reliving the Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders down Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed Harry had reached the shed He leaned against the windows glowing red in the setting sun Gryffindor in the castle Clearly not wanting to be seen it walked Harrys victory faded from his mind as he watched sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at and took off Gliding silently over the castle he saw had gone He flew in circles lower and lower voices He glided toward them and landed noiselessly holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through wasnt alone Quirrell was there too Harry couldnt worse than ever Harry strained to catch what they all pplaces Severus  Oh I thought wed keep this private said Snape his the Sorcerers Stone after all Harry leaned forward Quirrell was mumbling Hagrids yet Bbbut Severus I   You dont want me as your enemy Quirrell said tree He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say   your little bit of hocuspocus Im waiting chat soon when youve had time to think things over clearing It was almost dark now but Harry could see

himself about not meddling All the same hed have gambled twelve Sorcerers what Harry had just heard Snape would be walking have given in at last Harry went back to the library where Hermione was heard Snapes done it then said Ron If Quirrells told without asking Hagrid said Ron looking up at the book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a eyes but Hermione answered before Harry could Go to

Its not easy ter catch knew one ter be hurt before They walked past a mossy tree stump Harry could somewhere close by There were still spots of unicorn worry it cantve gone far if its this badly hurt an off the path behind a towering oak He pulled out an to fire The three of them listened Something was cloak trailing along the ground Hagrid was squinting faded away I knew it he murmured Theres

chestnut body dropped Oh its you Ronan said Hagrid in relief How are deep sorrowful voice Were you going to shoot me Cant be too careful Ronan said Hagrid patting his This is Harry Potter an Hermione

Listen Im glad bin hurt  you seen anythin Ronan didnt answer immediately He stared Ronan Anythin unusual Mars is bright tonight Ronan repeated while nearer home said Hagrid So yeh havent noticed said The forest hides many secrets A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than seen anythin odd in here lately Theres a unicorn skyward Mars is bright

Harry me that was whats bin killin the unicorns  never kept looking nervously over his shoulder He had the glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them Hermione grabbed Hagrid s arm Hagrid Look Red sparks the others are in trouble You two wait here Hagrid shouted Stay on the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very rustling of leaves around them You dont think theyve been hurt do you Neville  its our fault hes here in the first place The minutes dragged by Their ears seemed sharper sigh of the wind every cracking twig What was going return Malfoy Neville and Fang were with him up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke Neville Well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket Neville you stay with me an Hermione Harry you go whisper to Harry but hell have a harder time Malfoy and Fang They walked for nearly half an became almost impossible to follow because the trees getting thicker There were splashes on the roots of a around in pain close by Harry could see a clearing oak Look   he murmured holding out his arm to stop They inched closer It was the unicorn all right and it was dead Harry long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where the dark leaves Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering the edge of the clearing quivered  Then out of the ground like some stalking beast Harry Malfoy and unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the AAAAAAAAAAARGH   Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted  so did right at Harry  unicorn blood was dribbling down its  he couldnt move for fear Then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his blinded he staggered backward He heard hooves over Harry charging at the figure The pain in Harrys head was so bad he fell to his looked up the figure had gone A centaur was looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a his feet Yes  thank you  what was that The centaur didnt answer He had astonishingly blue Harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out back to Hagrid The forest is not safe at this time  this way My name is Firenze he added as he lowered clamber onto his back the other side of the clearing Ronan and Bane came sweaty Firenze Bane thundered What are you doing You you a common mule Do you realize who this is said Firenze This is the better What have you been telling him growled Bane ourselves against the heavens Have we not read what thought he was acting for the best he said in his are concerned with what has been foretold It is not humans in our forest Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger Bane Do you not understand why it was killed Or myself against what is lurking in this forest Bane And Firenze whisked around with Harry clutching on leaving Ronan and Bane behind them Harry didnt have a clue what was going on Whys Bane so angry he asked What was that head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did through the trees in silence for so long that Harry They were passing through a particularly dense patch used for No said Harry startled by the odd question Weve unicorn said Firenze Only one who has nothing to crime The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even You have slain something pure and defenseless to cursed life from the moment the blood touches your dappled silver in the moonlight But whod be that desperate he wondered aloud If it alive long enough to drink something else  and power  something that will mean you can never school at this very moment The Sorcerers Stone Of course  the Elixir of Life to return to power who has clung to life awaiting around Harrys heart Over the rustling of the trees him on the night they had met Some say he died human left in him to die Do you mean Harry croaked that was VoZ   Harry Harry are you all right Hermione was running toward them down the path saying The unicorns dead Hagrid its in that Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn You are Good luck Harry Potter said Firenze The planets I hope this is one of those times He turned and cantered back into the depths of the waiting for them to return He shouted something awake In a matter of seconds though he was wide had happened in the forest Harry couldnt sit down He paced up and down in Voldemorts waiting in the forest  and all this time whisper as if he thought Voldemort could hear them Harry wasnt listening Firenze saved me but he shouldnt have done so  with what the planets say is going to happen  They thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me  I Stone Harry went on feverishly then Voldemort will Bane  be happy of comfort Harry everyone says Dumbledores the only one around YouKnowWho wont touch you Anyway fortunetelling to me and Professor McGonagall says They went to bed exhausted their throats sore But Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR In years to

which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating called them one by one into his class to see if they Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse snuffbox was but taken away if it had whiskers necks while they tried to remember how to make a stabbing pains in his forehead which had been Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except hooded figure dripping blood in it Maybe it was because they hadnt seen what Harry scars burning on their foreheads but Ron and Harry The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them were so busy with their studying they didnt have might be up to Their very last exam was History of Magic One hour invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free results came out When the ghost of Professor Binns parchment Harry couldnt help cheering with the Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto  Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of papers afterward but Ron said this made him feel ill a tree The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were basking in the warm shallows No more studying Ron sighed happily stretching weve done theres no need to worry yet Harry was rubbing his forehead I wish I

nearly had his leg ripped off once hes not going to for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down Harry nodded but he couldnt shake off a lurking something important When he tried to explain this

common room Wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it wandering along on its own   What are you doing said a voice from the corner of clutching Trevor the toad who looked as though hed putting

Nevilles arms snapped to his sides His legs sprang stood and then fell flat on his face stiff as a board Hermione ran to turn him over Nevilles jaws were were moving looking at them in horror Oh Neville Im so sorry We had to Neville no time to explain said Harry Youll understand later Neville said Ron as they feel like a very good omen In their nervous state breath of wind sounded like Peeves

trip Whos there he said suddenly as they climbed Know youre there even if I cant see you Are you them Should call Filch I should if somethings acreeping Harry had a sudden idea Peeves he said in a

open door somehow seemed to impress Underneath the cloak Harry turned to the other two If you want to go back I wont blame you he said Were coming said Hermione Harry pushed the door open As the door creaked low rumbling growls met their direction even though it couldnt see them Whats that at its feet Hermione whispered Looks like a harp said Ron Snape must have left it Harry Well here goes  He put Hagrids flute to his lips and blew It wasnt began to droop Harry hardly drew breath Slowly the to its knees then it slumped to the ground fast of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor They approached the giant heads I think well be able to pull the door open said Ron Hermione No I dont All right Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully trapdoor which swung up and open What can you see Hermione said anxiously down well just have to drop Harry who was still playing the flute waved at Ron to dont know how deep this thing goes Give the flute to silence the dog growled and twitched but the deep sleep Harry climbed over it and looked down through the hanging on by his fingertips Then he looked up at follow Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to he fell down down down and  FLUMP With a funny muffled sort of thump he his eyes not used to the gloom It felt as though he postage stamp which was the open trapdoor its a Ron followed right away He landed sprawled next to to break the fall Come on Hermione The distant music stopped There was a loud bark landed on Harrys other side We must be miles under the school she said Lucky this plant things here really said Ron Lucky shrieked Hermione Look at you both She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall She the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils had already been bound tightly in long creepers plant got a firm grip on her Now she watched in them but the more they strained against it the this is  its Devils Snare Oh Im so glad we know what its called thats a the plant from curling around his neck Hermione Well hurry up I cant breathe Harry gasped Sprout say  it likes the dark and the damp   So light a fire Harry choked Yes  of course  but theres no wood Hermione WITCH OR NOT Oh right said Hermione and she whipped out her the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light from their bodies and they were able to pull free Lucky you pay attention in Herbology Hermione off his face Yeah said Ron and lucky Harry doesnt lose his passageway which was the only way forward All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the passageway sloped downward and Harry was heart he remembered the dragons said to be dragon a fullygrown dragon  Norbert had been bad be coming from up ahead Do you think its a ghost I dont know  sounds like wings to me Theres light ahead  I can see something moving They reached the end of the passageway and saw arching high above them It was full of small jewel room On the opposite side of the chamber was a said Ron Probably said Harry They dont look very vicious well theres no other choice  Ill run He took a deep breath covered his face with his arms sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second untouched He pulled the handle but it was locked The other two followed him They tugged and heaved Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm said Hermione They watched the birds soaring overhead glittering  keys Winged keys  look carefully So that must other two squinted up at the flock of keys  yes  door But there are hundreds of them Ron examined the lock on the door Were looking for a big oldfashioned one  probably air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys They and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to Seeker in a century He had a knack for spotting about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the there  no there  with bright blue wings  the Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was his broom Weve got to close in on it Harry called not taking come at it from above  Hermione stay below and Right NOW Ron dived Hermione rocketed upward the key toward the wall Harry leaned forward and with a with one hand Ron and Hermione s cheers echoed key struggling in his hand He rammed it into the lock clicked open the key took flight again looking very door handle They nodded He pulled the door open The next chamber was so dark they couldnt see suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing behind the black chessmen which were all taller than stone Facing them way across the chamber were slightly  the towering white chessmen had no faces Now what do we do Harry whispered way across the room Behind the white pieces they could see another door How said Hermione nervously I think said Ron were going to have to be to touch the knights horse At once the stone sprang turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron Do we  er  have to join you to get across The black knight nodded Ron turned to the other weve got to take the place of three of the black pieces Harry and Hermione stayed quiet watching Ron anything but neither of you are that good at chess  Were not offended said Harry quickly Just tell us

across the board Yes  look  A white pawn had moved forward two squares Ron started to direct the black pieces They moved trembling What if they lost Harry  move diagonally four squares to the right Their first real shock came when their other knight and dragged him off the board where he lay quite Leaves you free to take that bishop Hermione go showed no mercy Soon there was a huddle of limp just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in almost as many white pieces as they had lost black think  let me think  The white queen turned her blank face toward him to be taken NO Harry and Hermione shouted Thats chess snapped Ron Youve got to make that leaves you free to checkmate the king Harry But   Do you want to stop Snape or not Ron   Look if you dont hurry up hell already have the Here I go  now dont hang around once youve She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone screamed but stayed on her square  the white been knocked out Shaking Harry moved three spaces to the left The white king took off his crown and threw it at bowed leaving the door ahead clear With one last charged through the door and up the next What if hes   Hell be all right said Harry trying to convince Flitwick mustve put charms on the keys McGonagall leaves Quirrells spell and Snapes  They had reached another door All right Harry whispered Go on Harry pushed it open A disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a cold with a bloody lump on its head Im glad we didnt have to fight that one Harry massive legs Come on I cant breathe He pulled open the next door both of them hardly nothing very frightening in here just a table with line Snapes said Harry What do we have to do They stepped over the threshold and immediately a ordinary fire either it was purple At the same onward They were trapped Look Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to four First however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wines left side Second different are those who stand at either end But if you would move onward neither is your friend Third as you see clearly all are different size Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides Fourth the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them though different at first Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry amazed saw doing Brilliant said Hermione This isnt magic  its got an ounce of logic theyd be stuck in here forever But so will we wont we Of course not said Hermione Everything we need two are wine one will get us safely through the black walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to hands Got it she said The smallest bottle will get us Thats hardly one swallow They looked at each other Which one will get you back through the purple of the line get Ron Grab brooms from the flyingkey room go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Snape off for a while but Im no match for him pointing at his scar I might get lucky again Hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at embarrassed as she let go of him Me said Hermione Books And cleverness There and  oh Harry  be carefull You drink first said Harry You are sure which is the round bottle at the end and shuddered Its not poison said Harry anxiously No  but its like ice Quick go before it wears off purple fire Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest in one gulp It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body He himself saw the black flames licking his body but nothing but dark fire  then he was on the other Snape It wasnt even Voldemort meeting you here Potter But I thought  Snape   Severus Quirrell laughed and it wasnt his usual Severus does seem the type doesnt he So useful to stuttering PProfessor Quirrell Harry couldnt take it in This couldnt be true it Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed broke my eye contact with you Another few seconds it before then if Snape hadnt been muttering a he wanted to referee your next match He was trying neednt have bothered I couldnt do anything with Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning he time when after all that Im going to kill you tonight Quirrell snapped his fingers Ropes sprang out of thin school on Halloween like that for all I knew youd Stone  You let the troll in Certainly I have a special gift with trolls  you must there Unfortunately while everyone else was suspected me went straight to the third floor to head death that threeheaded dog didnt even manage to Now wait quietly Potter I need to examine this standing behind Quirrell It was the Mirror of Erised This mirror is the key to finding the Stone Quirrell Dumbledore to come up with something like this    gets back  All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell mirror I saw you and Snape in the forest   he blurted out Yes said Quirrell idly walking around the mirror to trying to find out how far Id got He suspected me all when I had Lord Voldemort on my side  Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and but where is it Harry struggled against the ropes binding him but his whole attention to the mirror But Snape always seemed to hate me so much Oh he does said Quirrell casually heavens yes know They loathed each other But he never wanted Snape was threatening you For the first time a spasm of fear flitted across masters instructions  he is a great wizard and I am Harry gasped He is with me wherever I go said Quirrell quietly I young man I was then full of ridiculous ideas about I was There is no good and evil there is only power served him faithfully although I have let him down Quirrell shivered suddenly He does not forgive Gringotts he was most displeased He punished me me  Quirrells voice trailed away Harry was remembering stupid Hed seen Quirrell there that very day shaken Should I break it the moment he thought is to find the Stone before my self finding it  which means Ill see where its what Im up to He tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass ankles were too tight he tripped and fell over Quirrell me Master And to Harrys horror a voice answered and the voice Harry fell off Harry got slowly to his feet Come here Quirrell repeated Look in the mirror about what I see thats all Quirrell moved close behind him Harry breathed in turban He closed his eyes stepped in front of the But a moment later the reflection smiled at him It red stone It winked and put the Stone back in its drop into his real pocket Somehow  incredibly  Harry screwed up his courage I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore he he felt the Sorcerers Stone against his leg Dare he spoke though Quirrell wasnt moving his lips He lies  He lies  Potter come back here Quirrell shouted Tell me Harry felt as if Devils Snare was rooting him to the watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap Quirrells head looked strangely small without it Then he turned slowly on the spot Harry would have screamed but he couldnt make a Quirrells head there was a face the most terrible glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils like a snake Harry Potter  it whispered Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs shadow and vapor  I have form only when I can those willing to let me into their hearts and minds     you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the able to create a body of my own  Now  why dont Harrys legs He stumbled backward Dont be a fool snarled the face Better save your your parents  They died begging me for mercy  LIAR Harry shouted suddenly Voldemort could still see him The evil face was now father first and he put up a courageous fight    but protect you  Now give me the Stone unless you screamed SEIZE HIM and the next second Harry needlesharp pain seared across Harrys scar his yelled struggling with all his might and to his lessened  he looked around wildly to see where looking at his fingers  they were blistering before his and Quirrell lunged knocking Harry clean off his feet neck  Harrys scar was almost blinding him with hands And Quirrell though pinning Harry to the ground bewildered at his own palms  Harry could see they Then kill him fool and be done screeched but Harry by instinct reached up and grabbed then Harry knew Quirrell couldnt touch his bare chance was to keep hold of Quirrell keep him in and hung on as tight as he could Quirrell screamed head was building  he couldnt see  he could only of KILL HIM KILL HIM and other voices maybe in all was lost and fell into blackness down  down  Snitch He tried to catch it but his arms were too glasses How strange He blinked again The smiling face of Albus Harry stared at him Then he remembered Sir The times said Dumbledore Quirrell does not have the thrown out Harry swallowed and looked around him He realized with white linen sheets and next to him was a table Dumbledore beaming What happened down in the complete secret so naturally the whole school Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a you Madam Pomfrey however felt it might not be will be most relieved you have come round they have Stone Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it you were doing very well on your own I must say You got there You got Hermiones owl We must have crossed in midair No sooner had I place I should be was the one I had just left I arrived Stone much longer   Not the Stone boy you  the effort involved nearly it had As for the Stone it has been destroyed Destroyed said Harry blankly But your friend  sounding quite delighted You did do the thing little chat and agreed its all for the best But that means he and his wife will die wont they They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in Harrys face To one as young as you Im sure it seems incredible bed after a very very long day After all to the well adventure You know the Stone was really not such a could want The two things most human beings would knack of choosing precisely those things that are a little and smiled at the ceiling Sir said Harry Ive been thinking  Sir  even if name for things Fear of a name increases fear of the coming back isnt he I mean he hasnt gone has somewhere perhaps looking for another body to left Quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his you may only have delayed his return to power it will what seems a losing battle next time  and if he is to power Harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made other things Id like to know if you can tell me  The truth Dumbledore sighed It is a beautiful and great caution However I shall answer your questions I beg you  forgive me I shall not of course lie Well  Voldemort said that he only killed my mother why would he want to kill me in the first place Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time Alas the first thing you ask me I cannot tell you Not today Not now You will know one day  put it I know you hate to hear this    when you are ready Voldemort cannot understand it is love He didnt leaves its own mark Not a scar no visible sign  to who loved us is gone will give us some protection greed and ambition sharing his soul with Voldemort touch a person marked by something so good Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out eyes on the sheet When he had found his voice again who sent it to me possession and I thought you might like it father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens hated my father Is that true Well they did rather detest each other Not unlike something Snape could never forgive What He saved his life What Yes  said Dumbledore dreamily Funny the way couldnt bear being in your fathers debt  I do because he felt that would make him and your father memory in peace  Harry tried to understand this but it made his head Just the one How did I get the Stone out of the mirror Ah now Im glad you asked me that It was one of thats saying something You see only one who would be able to get it otherwise theyd just see brain surprises even me sometimes  Now enough sweets Ah Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans I was vomitflavored one and since then Im afraid Ive with a nice toffee dont you He smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his very strict Just five minutes Harry pleaded Absolutely not You let Professor Dumbledore in  Well of course that was the headmaster quite on Madam Pomfrey  Oh very well she said But five minutes only And she let Ron and Hermione in again but Harry was glad she held herself in as his Dumbledore was so worried   The whole schools talking about it said Ron What is even more strange and exciting than the wild mirror the Stone and Voldemort Ron and Hermione right places and when Harry told them what was going to die Thats what I said but Dumbledore thinks that  but the next great adventure  I always said he was off his rocker said Ron Ron round  that took a while  and we were we met him in the entrance hall  he already knew  hurtled off to the third floor Sending you your fathers cloak and everything Well Hermione exploded if he did  I mean to say man Dumbledore I think he sort of wanted to give everything that goes on here you know I reckon he instead of stopping us he just taught us enough to out how the mirror worked Its almost like he thought Ron proudly Listen youve got to be up for the end Slytherin won of course  you missed the last Ravenclaw without you  but the foodll be good At that moment Madam Pomfrey bustled over Youve had nearly fifteen minutes now OUT she normal I want to go to the feast he told Madam Pomfrey as I go she said sniffily as though in her opinion could be And you have another visitor Oh good said Harry Who is it Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke As usual allowed He sat down next to Harry took one look at face in his hands I told the evil git how ter get past know an I told him Yeh couldve died All fer a out an made ter live as a Muggle Hagrid said Harry shocked to see Hagrid shaking his beard Hagrid hed have found out somehow out even if you hadnt told him Yeh couldve died sobbed Hagrid An don say the shocked he stopped crying Ive met him and Im saved the Stone its gone he cant use it Have a said That reminds me Ive got yeh a present Its not a stoat sandwich is it said Harry Nah Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter anyway got y eh this  It seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book photographs Smiling and waving at him from every askin fer photos  knew yeh didn have any  dyeh alone that night He had been held up by Madam last checkup so the Great Hall was already full It silver to celebrate Slytherin s winning the House Cup the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the then everybody started talking loudly at once He Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that babble died away Another year gone Dumbledore said cheerfully And I must trouble you with an old mans wheezing feast What a year it has been Hopefully your heads before next year starts  Now as I understand it the House Cup here needs Gryffindor with three hundred and twelve points in Ravenclaw has four hundred and twentysix and Slytherin table Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging However recent events must be taken into account The room went very still The Slytherins smiles faded points to dish out Let me see Yes  First  to Mr Ronald Weasley  Ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish seen in many years I award Gryffindor House fifty the stars overhead seemed to quiver Percy could be know My youngest brother Got past McGonagalls Second  to Miss Hermione Granger    for the use of fifty points Hermione buried her face in her arms Harry strongly and down the table were beside themselves  they outstanding courage I award Gryffindor House sixty yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now the same as Slytherin They had tied for the House more point Dumbledore raised his hand The room gradually fell smiling It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up friends I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville have thought some sort of explosion had taken place Gryffindor table Harry Ron and Hermione stood up disappeared under a pile of people hugging him He before Harry still cheering nudged Ron in the ribs Curse put on him Which means Dumbledore called over the storm of celebrating the downfall of Slytherin we need a little hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold Gryffindor lion took its place Snape was shaking smile He caught Harrys eye and Harry knew at once jot This didnt worry Harry It seemed as though life ever was at Hogwarts It was the best evening of Harrys life better than mountain trolls  he would never ever forget tonight Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results surprise both he and Ron passed with good marks years Even Neville scraped through his good one They had hoped that Goyle who was almost as had passed too It was a shame but as Ron said you trunks were packed Nevilles toad was found lurking students warning them not to use magic over the take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across talking and laughing as the countryside became Beans as they sped past Muggle towns pulling off pulling into platform nine and threequarters at platform A wizened old guard was up by the ticket threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting both of you  Ill send you an owl Thanks said Harry Ill need something to look gateway back
