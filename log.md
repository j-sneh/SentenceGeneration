# Development Log

### 04/03/2022
1. We initially wanted to get our proposal approved and find datasets + create an initial commit with the structure of our codebase. Unfortunately, our proposal needed significant revision, so we met and really got into the nitty-gritty of what we wanted to accomplish. We found our datasets as well, which puts us pretty neatly on schedule if we work significantly in the next week.
2. We all worked on revising/editing/brainstorming for our proposal this week.
3. It was hard to schedule a time and also our proposal wasn't approved, so we had to work on that instead of moving forward.
4. We plan to actually write some code â€” more organizational is likely (function decomposition, making a small sample text, picking data structures, etc.) We may also do some text pre-processing in Python to strip "garbage".

### 4/10/2022
1. Our proposal wasn't approved, so we spent more time going over what we had to do.
2. We found a lot of minutae that was bogging our project down, and attempted to resolve these issues on paper.
